[Phil buys](https://youneedastereo.com/#2021-10-26%20Journal) some nice gear! ü§ë

[Get your REALMS in the latest auction!](https://gotchiverse.io/) Website seems very buggy at the moment, so maybe worth waiting a day or two‚Ä¶I do like the art style and maybe now the ‚Äúgame‚Äù will actually have something to do.

[Been on another Dave‚Äôs software rabbit trail. Ended up on this blog post from 2000 which is a series of good questions to ask yourself if you‚Äôre in the pursuit of FIRE. (Surely everyone is once they know what it is?). I liked it.](http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html)

[I like the look of those opml pages that Dave writes his docs in, and I was trying to find out how to do it. I managed to find it and here‚Äôs my own notes with links. I‚Äôd quite like to set this up on my own domain for publishing outlines. I think I just setup page park and point it at the opml and it renders it fine? Not quite sure, so I‚Äôll mess about with it tonight and see.](http://my.this.how/thealexjj/testing.opml)

For example [this is a nice living space computer](https://www.hp.com/uk-en/chrome/chromebase-all-in-one-desktop.html).

[Running GNU+Linux on a Chromebook](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439) looks a lot easier these days than it used to be. Given all I use are web apps, maybe a Chromebook would be a nice tool.
