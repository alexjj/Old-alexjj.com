Here’s a fun [podcast episode](https://changelog.com/jsparty/172) from JS Party where they talk about the hardware and software they use. A lot of macs and vim! One Omnifocus user. Website has links to everything if you don’t want to listen. [Brian](https://github.com/bdougie) (who works at Github) has amazing examples of [Github automation](https://github.com/bdougie/live) and making the most of actions, Github’s GraphQL, and special repos. Interesting stuff to dig into.
