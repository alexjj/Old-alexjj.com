I'm back on to wondering about Tinderbox again. I was reading [Phil's notes](https://youneedastereo.com/#2021-12-27%20Journal) about Tinderbox and the references he posts. It is a very unique piece of software that can do all sorts. I already knew this. The trouble right now is we've been visiting family and I'm just with my iPad, so I wouldn't be able to add anything to a Tinderbox file. Maybe that doesn't matter...in fact it doesn't. It is expensive as far as software goes but it's like a fancy meal for 6 or something.
