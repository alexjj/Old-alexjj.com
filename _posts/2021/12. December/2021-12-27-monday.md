I've setup WebDAV on my server, and am using 1Writer on my iPad/iPhone to write to my new plain text journal/daybook thing. I wasn't really sure what to call each file or even how to structure them. I guess I'll see how it goes. 1Writer is nice though. Started looking at some of the javascript actions to see if there's anything useful.

WebDAV with nginx was a bit of a pain. Seems nginx is strict and most clients (including Finder and Windows explorer...oh you know the two largest clients) don't do what they're supposed to do. Namely trailing slashes for new directories. Random blog posts yielded nginx rewrites to fix it. Probably some other issues but for now it works fine. Much cheaper than dropbox...

Still trying to ignore [Jack's](https://daily.baty.net/posts/2021/12/26/Note-icons-on-the-archiv.html) fun with Tinderbox, doing all sorts of clever tricks.

I can't buy a Ricoh GRiii as I think it's too expensive, but then look at a Leica Q2M and think "oh a new one is *only* Â£4,995". ðŸ™ˆ

Hooking up this blog to 1writer might be a nice idea. I guess that means buying Working Copy app...or cloning the repo into the webdav folder on the server then somehow commiting the new entries. I can SSH in but maybe some shortcut thing that calls a script or API to then do it...ðŸ¤” sounds overly complex...
