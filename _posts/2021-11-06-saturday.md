Kids donâ€™t know how easy they have it these days with SSL from Letâ€™s encrypt. One line `sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain` and it does everything for you. Even edits your nginx config where it finds the domain to add all the SSL certs and recommended settings to secure a strong rating. I remember when startssl (I think) began offering one free SSL cert per year. Youâ€™d have to go through various hoops to prove yourself and then download the certification, upload it to your server and then figure out all the settings. There was a [gist somewhere](https://gist.github.com/konklone/6532544) that had recommended settings and generating your own dhparam key and everything. Now just install nginx and certbot and away you go. Scores an A on [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).

If youâ€™re after a new VPS this month then wait until black friday/cyber monday and have a look on [lowendtalk](https://www.lowendtalk.com/), always lots of great deals (in fact too many). Iâ€™ve picked up great VPSs over the years for \~\$15/**year** that have all run perfectly for my self-hosted sites. [Inception hosting](https://inceptionhosting.com/) is one of my favourites, [Virmach](https://virmach.com/) have been good too. Iâ€™m looking for a new photo gallery hosting site to upgrade my \$4/yr OpenVZ VPS special ðŸ˜…

Playing around with [PhotoFloat](https://github.com/alexjj/photofloat) again, and I do like static gen websites. Itâ€™s python2 but still makes a nice site. I currently use Piwigo for gallery website, which is a great piece of software, but has lots of features I donâ€™t really care about. However, their hosted service with unlimited storage is nice for big photo collections.
