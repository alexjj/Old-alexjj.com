Like all self-hosted blogs, they tend to get stale - mostly as the author stops writing in them. This one is no exception to that. After using drummer last year for a while I realised I enjoyed writing blog posts that were just the date and then some stuff. The stuff could be related or not. It was easy for me and I'd never written so much online before. I moved away from drummer as I wanted more control over it, but resumed the daily posts style. At a similar time I'd been using Tiddlywiki (TW) as a wiki/blog/journal thing and found it hard to know what went where. TW also offered a really easy entry point that works well on all devices, and I found I wanted that more than anything else. This meant it didn't really make sense to have **two** places that were structured as daily posts. It confused me as to what to write where. So after a very long journey, this blog is back to being a traditional, post by title/topic. It does risk dying very quickly as I never get round to writing much but I'm hopeful that isn't the case. One thing I'm considering is weekly summary posts - stuff that is small and doesn't warrant a whole post on its own but nevertheless perhaps of interest. It might also help me keep up with the list of projects I've given myself this easter holidays, perhaps giving updates or some such. I've also realised, although still struggle with, the fact that blog posts don't *need* to be 4,000 words.

I have some old posts I should copy across here for longevity and I think I drafted a few other things in an older version of this blog that I should find.

I much prefer static blogs to Wordpress or anything like that, although images can be tiresome. Debating if the front page should be a list, like the [archive](/archive/) - perhaps with a summary line, or just the full posts and maybe pagination. I'm leaning towards a list with the summary. I may even completely redo the CSS and layout should I need to waste more time.

Happy Easter! üê£
