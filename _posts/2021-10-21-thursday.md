For a blast from the past have a look at your Blogger [*Blogs I follow*](https://www.blogger.com/manage-blogs-following.g?pli=1)…

[The new Voigtländer 90mm APO f/2.8 is now available to pre-order…oh dear…It’s 250g and 60mm long.](https://www.dpreview.com/news/2015050634/you-can-now-pre-order-the-new-voigtlander-90mm-f2-8-apo-skopar-m-mount-lens-for-799)

[@Phil](https://youneedastereo.com/#2021-10-21%20Journal), we were one step away from finding your house and standing over you until you made a [Drummer blog](http://oldschool.scripting.com/twelvety/) :) Welcome! It took me a few days to figure it out, and I still use my Tiddlywiki, and it’s somewhat random what goes where, but the wiki tends to be more chatty, least at the moment. I’m intrigued you [find Drummer easier to use](http://oldschool.scripting.com/twelvety/2021/10/21.html#a151655) than Tiddlywiki on the phone. I can’t see anything when I open drummer on my phone, I turn it landscape but it’s all overflowing, but TW fits to the screen.

Took the boys for the their haircuts. The barber was a very strict Italian man who kept them sitting up straight the whole time. I enjoyed it.
