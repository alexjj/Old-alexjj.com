So Obsidian has released [mobile apps](https://obsidian.md/mobile) now. For free. You can use iCloud sync or pay for their sync or maybe git via Working Copy. A quick test of it (on iPad) and the mobile app is very impressive, looks to have most, if not all, the features of the desktop app. Has a nice toolbar that you can customise, gestures to open command palette. I think I like it more than the desktop app! If you just use Apple products, it’s a pretty decent setup. If you paid for Publish it would make for a great experience. I just don’t like the desktop app nor want to pay \$192 / year for it. Probably if I looked someone has made a static html generator using your Obsidian notes. e.g. [1](https://github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link), [2](https://marco.kamner.eu/notes/technology/obsidian/publish-obsidian-to-personal-site/)

I’ve come back to thinking I want a reMarkable (or similar) tablet again. I love paper notebooks to flick back through for some information but once I move to a new book this is impossible. Also like the idea of annotating/note taking from a book at the same time. Have to actually research how good it really is first. Seems Supernote might be better. Will take this research line over to the [wiki](https://fondoftea.com/#e-Ink%20Tablets).

Whilst looking up the name of the next [Stormlight Archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive)book to read, I found out about another epic fantasy series, [Realm of the Elderlingsby Robin Hodd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hobb#The_Realm_of_the_Elderlings).


Ordered a copy (digital and physical) of Derek Siver’s new book "[How to Live](https://sive.rs/h)". It sounded very interesting and thought provoking. Going to give the physical copy to my sister.
