Had to cut the lawn, although it’s been raining for weeks and it’s still wet, but I did it anyway. I usually listen to [talkpython.fm](https://talkpython.fm/) podcast but the most recent ones looked boring from my perspective. So I thought I’d search for [Dave Winer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer). I’d not really heard of him until I somehow got to know about Drummer (most likely via [Jack](https://baty.blog/)). I found [this one from Nov 2020](https://thisweekinstartups.com/e1133-podcast-blogging-pioneer-dave-winer-on-inventing-new-forms-of-media-tribalism-on-social-media-tales-of-the-golden-age-of-silicon-valley-more/). It’s fascinating to listen to the early days of the internet, and generally any of Dave’s stories from the early days of tech and silicon valley (including meeting with Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and others back in the early days). It was also during peak COVID lockdown.
