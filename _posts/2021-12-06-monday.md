I want to put in my [old drummer](http://oldschool.scripting.com/thealexjj/?tab=blog) posts into this site. So I've used pandoc to convert my opml file into a single markdown file. This was very easy `pandoc --from=opml --to=markdown_mmd blog.opml -o blog.md`. However, that makes it one big file, not individual pages. I don't have that many posts, but I don't really want to make a whole load of files to copy and paste this info into. For now it's just a single page [here](/blog). I've also noticed images aren't referenced or showing up. What might be a better way to generate the markdown would be from the rendered HTML, that way images and everything exactly how it shows will be created. If I'm making pages then I may be better off making my own converter, reading the opml and making pages. However, this'll just be a one off thing, so not super excited to put a lot of time into this. Maybe just generating the pages might be a start with `published=false` and then I can pick away it at over time.
