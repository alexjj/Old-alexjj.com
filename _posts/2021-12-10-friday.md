Debating about either adding tags to these daily posts, in the vague attempt at helping discoverability and future usefulness or switching it more into a more traditional blog with titles, categories, etc. where posts are about a topic and not a collection of parts. Just writing under a date heading is very easy to do, but not sure it's any more productive to the world than random chatter on twitter. Another factor is having the [wiki](https://fondoftea.com) and some duplication of the daily journal on that. The problem with changing it all is then I question the very architecture of it, and that risks starting from scratch.

For example, I'm using jekyll because I started off with [journal.txt](https://journaltxt.github.io/) and that was Ruby and Jekyll. Jekyll is also very easy with Github pages. However, Hugo and others are super easy too. Whilst Jekyll is maintained, I can't help feel it's 5 years out of date and if I were starting a fresh blog I'd probably pick Hugo. 

The one saving grace is that this consumes so much of my brain cycles that I don't think about buying new cameras. ðŸ˜…
