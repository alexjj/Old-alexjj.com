Slowly getting there ☝

I wish we used things like git, markdown, wikis and plain text at work for procedures and documentation. Would be so much easier to maintain, update, track changes, find information. But no, it's a whole bunch of Word documents spread across (at best) SharePoint, a document management tool, and network drives.

Friend bought me [Valheim](https://www.valheimgame.com/) and we started a server last night. These survival/crafting games are all the same but the best part is playing with a few friends because of the chat.

I'm liking TickTick for it's quickness to add stuff. Particularly ideas or longer term things I'd like to do. It's much quicker than tiddlywiki, maybe similar to Apple reminders but TickTick has the advantage of being cross platform and the website is much better than icloud.com website. Maybe if I tried hard enough I could use Apple reminders...but I don't need to so there's that.

I'm compiling a list of "projects" I want to do in 2022.
