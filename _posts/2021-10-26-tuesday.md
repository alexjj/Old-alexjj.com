Been thinking about how I can get data into Drummer, particularly data I write on my phone as Drummer on my phone is..unpleasant. However there are other good apps, like dynalist and Zavala, for writing on phone. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a way to push data into Drummer, unless the token in the download files button works to upload, but I could use the schedule to load a file from somewhere. The only caveat is that it has to be publicly available. OR I just import it manually when I have something to add. But Iâ€™d still like the ability to push data in for future ideas.

Why will none of our iPads update to iPadOS 15â€¦

I keep a private tiddlywiki for work, but Iâ€™m considering a private outline in Drummer. I think having everything viewable in a single page would be more useful than a wiki. Something like Notion or Airtable might be good for work but theyâ€™re strict about posting information outside work network and I also canâ€™t be bothered with all the faff of those tools. One big list is my preferred option, as it usually just ends up being weekly summaries or results. The big â€˜+â€™ button makes it nice to add a day.

Jack has [wanted an improvement](%20%20https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Drummer%20Notes) to downloading his drummer outlines, and I would like it too if I started using private outlines more. Iâ€™d noticed the download link had a unique URL which meant I could likely access it directly outside of Drummer. I decided this lunchtime to have a little look and it does work. Hereâ€™s my [small python example](https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/63#issuecomment-951849007) but itâ€™ll work with other languages too. *Update*: everyone else in the thread have posted great alternatives too. Thereâ€™s one for everybody from Appleâ€™s Siri, to serverless Zapier to unix server cron ðŸ¤©
