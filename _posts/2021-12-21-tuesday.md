I started looking at Working Copy again. It is a very nice app for working with git repos on an iPad. However, I don't really want to do that much development or git writing on my ipad. Github.dev is good enough for this static site, and occasional tweaks.

The new Voigtlander 90mm f/2.8 VM is so good (according to reviews), how could I ever justify a Leica lens...
