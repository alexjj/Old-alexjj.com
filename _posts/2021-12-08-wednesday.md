[This presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/whitep4nth3r/how-to-prevent-the-collapse-of-society-by-building-an-accessible-web) about web accessibility is both very funny but also makes very good points about the state of the internet. Even as a completely able internet user the amount of crap websites pack in and everyone's obsession with javascript is very annoying. There are some stores that don't work on my home network as I block ad domains. This mostly annoys my wife when she wants to buy something and either I have to disable everything or she switches to cellular and buys it on her phone. My stance is that if the company's website is that bad then I'm not going to buy from them. My website is not at all important but I like that it's clean, fast and has minimal javacsript. It would have none but I like having search, and the image zoom when you click on an image. I'm also looking for an image gallery which might have to be javascript as well. I was looking at [fotorama](https://fotorama.io/), but it needs jQuery and that put me off. I'm sure I could do something to improve accessibility and I might look into some of the tools to check the site like:

* [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)
* [Colour contrast checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/)
* [axeÂ® - The Standard in Accessibility Testing](https://www.deque.com/axe/)

I made a list of all the non-fiction books I want to read...18 of them! Not sure I'll get to them all in 2022. Have to think about what and prioritise them. ðŸ¤”ðŸ§
