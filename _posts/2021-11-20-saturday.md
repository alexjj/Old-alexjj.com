The new (to me) Mac mini arrived, 2012 i7 model. Also came with a 23” Apple Cinema Display. Which is cool but it gets boiling and only one input is annoying with multiple computers. Not sure what I’ll do with that. Coming back to macOS after \~7 years takes a bit of getting used to. There’s a lot to setup and I feel like a lot of tricks to learn.
