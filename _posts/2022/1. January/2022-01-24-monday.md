I'm procrastinating on developing the 4x5. Not sure why. It should be better this time with the SP-445. The new tripod did arrive today, so that should help mounting the camera to photo them. It was also greeted with another look from my wife and "buying more things?" ðŸ˜…

Started watching the 6th season of The Expanse.

I felt ashamed of myself today at work, some sort of wisdom or proverb no doubt has warned me of this situation yet still I did it. I spent so long focusing on how others did a bad job that I didn't prepare myself and also ended up doing a bad job. Probably even worse than theirs. I don't think other people would've said any of our work was bad, but when people ask you to do things that you thought you'd already done, it's still not great.
