Family visiting so not much time on the computer so far this year.

We've been making a family video reenactment of Peter Pan for Granny's birthday. I'm on videography and post-production. I do enjoy making and putting it all together. The kids all have fun too. We should do more of it as a family. Although it takes **a lot** longer than photo editing! I ended up picking the iPad to record everything. It's okay but likely better on my XT-2. However, with the kids I have one opportunity and I want to make sure I capture it, and not be messing about with settings and focus etc.
