Not come across [this site](https://theconversation.com/uk) before it seems like a sane place to get opinions.

It's taken me several months to realise that if I paste a URL in VS Code whilst highlighting some text, it makes it a markdown link automatically ðŸ˜… Perhaps I should learn more about it as it's become my main tool for writing this site.

I am wondering about switching to [textile](https://textile-lang.com/) instead of markdown. Mostly so I can use paragraph formatting and add custom ids without a song and dance (Tinderbox ðŸ˜™). If I want one I can just write `p(#id)`. If I don't then just leave it blank and the default is a paragraph. Does mean I have to come up with the id name. Does also allow for more customisation of individual blocks with styles. Not sure if I really need that though, or just think I need it.
