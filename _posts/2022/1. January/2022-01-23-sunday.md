[Two threads talking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/sanxen/honest_oppinion_is_the_leica_glass_worth_it/) about if Leica glass "is worth it". Focused on M mount glass. I like my Voigtlander 35mm f1.4 II MC and don't think I'd notice the difference with the Leica equivalent. Still trying to pick up at least one Leica lens, just because, and the 90mm seems the most likely. Although I may give up given the limited availabilty of nice ones in the UK, and just get the new CV 90mm!

Everyone has tested positive now, so it'll be a fun week of all the kids at home.

YouTube keeps reminding me of all the Tinderbox guide videos I've not watched. Is it trying to help me or taunt me?
