My Spearman SP-445 arrived today. So hopefully that'll make 4x5 development easier, improve the results and be more consistent. I'll need to practice using it in the dark bag. Along with practicing loading the film holders too. Not entirely convinced I managed that correctly the first time.

Sent the angle-poise arm for film scanning back. It wobbled and was annoying to position. I should probably just get a tripod as that'll be useful for several things.
