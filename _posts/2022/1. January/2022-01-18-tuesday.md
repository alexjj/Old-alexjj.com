Last year during lockdown I bought a bike trainer, and subscribed to Zwift. It was quite fun for a couple of months but I didn't like paying for Zwift. Particularly as there were a lot of features I didn't care about and several that I did that were missing. I just want to know how far left on my ride!

I cancelled it and haven't sat back on the bike in about 9 months. I also don't like that it's heavy legs and nothing too much on upper body. I'd like an even workout. Also now that I'm back at the office I cycle to work each day and not really interested in doing more cycling at home.

So I want to buy a Concept 2 Rowerg. Amazon sell them and offer their free installment plan so it makes it less obvious you're sending money. They were out of stock and I'd set an alert and told myself when it comes back in I'll buy one. Well now that it is back in stock I'm agonising over the decision on whether or not to buy one.

Careful readers will point out I've not used my current equipment for 9 months so why would I use something else. Spending Â£800+ on a rower might not be the solution to the actual problem.

Other people would've just seen it in stock and thought "great, let's buy it". Then 10 seconds later they stop thinking about it until it arrives the following week.
