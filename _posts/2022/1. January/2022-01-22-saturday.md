We watched Howl's Moving Castle last night with out daughter. She's reading it as her school book but not getting on with it particularly well. Thought the visuals of it might encourage her. I've not read the book but have seen the film before, although such a long time I'd mostly forgotten what happens. She says there's quite a few differences from the book. Makes me want to read it now though. Funny that the book's author is an english woman, because of the film I assumed it was a Japanese book.

I had planned on doing some more 4x5 development last night but after the film was done it was too late to start that. I shouldn't leave it too long, but I also should practice loading the SP-445 first. I *still* need to find something to mount my camera on to take photos of the negative. I guessing I'm looking for the Â£50 copy stand. That's the amount I think they're worth and willing to pay but they don't exist. Or at least not readily available ones. I should look at that now and try and find something. Plus maybe some clips to hang drying negatives.
