Stupid house alarm. The battery in it seems to have gone flat or maybe the charging hasn't been working and now it needs to beep every 3 hours. You can acknowledge it but then it likes to remind you. So that was fun last night. I dislike house alarms. I'm fearful of trying to do anything in case it sets it off. All we were given was the code when we moved in. I've found a manual online, but it talks about manager codes and engineer codes - the fact that you might have to call someone out to reset it is absolutely disgusting. I guess I should tackle it at some point. 

Constructed a version of Pokemon cards that the boys can play. We just have pokemon and energy cards, and ignore evolutions. They like it though. I'm sucked into the online version and have no time for anything else ðŸ˜…
