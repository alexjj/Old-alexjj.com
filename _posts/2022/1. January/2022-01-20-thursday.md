Can't believe it's the 20th already.

Hmm the down arrow on my ipad smart keyboard doesn't reliably work. Guess it means I'll need to switch to Vim.

I really like The Expanse, and have just started watching season 6. If only I could remember what happened in the previous seasons. I do remember some things but not sure of the order and probably large gaps in between.

I've been running my dad's email off Google Suite for years, [now](https://9to5google.com/2022/01/19/g-suite-legacy-free-edition/) someone is going to have to pay...or we move it elsewhere. iCloud+ would be ideal, but think his Apple ID would need to be part of my family, which isn't ideal. Maybe I can add it for myself and then let him change the password or something but I'm sure it'll all be linked to iCloud accounts and likely to be a pain. I haven't actually received an email from Google myself so maybe my account is later or something...
