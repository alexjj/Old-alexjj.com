Can't believe it's the 20th already.

Hmm the down arrow on my ipad smart keyboard doesn't reliabily work. Guess it means I'll need to switch to Vim.

I really like The Expanse, and have just started watching season 6. If only I could remember what happened in the previous seasons. I do remember some things but not sure of the order and probably large gaps in between.
