Almost the end of February and I think it's time to rejig things with my sites. I've fallen off using this site, and mostly not used any site this month. However, I think I want to move to just the wiki for daily notes and then make this site a bit more of a traditional blog. It does risk that this site becomes a silent lot. I'm mostly motivated by the ease at which I can add to the wiki. This site isn't hard but the wiki is still easier.

I also want to migrate this daily-stuff to the wiki mostly as there are no expectations over there and I don't care if I repeatedly talk about buying the same thing for 6 months and still not buy it, or how I should do something but then never do it.

So perhaps as March is about to appear I should do the big of sys admin work to sort things out.
