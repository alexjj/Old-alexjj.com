I was very close to buying Tinderbox last night. I know buying stuff at 11:30 pm is never a good idea. Even with the discount it's still Â£175. I just can't get over that. I've been watching more videos on it. The interface is still weird but I get it a bit more now. I've also downloaded the demo version and started messing about with it, just random stuff. I ordered the Tinderbox way as that had 25% off. Although maybe shouldn't have bothered.

[Obsidian live preview](https://help.obsidian.md/Live+preview+update). This is what I wanted from the start. Now I'm looking at Obsidian again. It does have iOS apps which is nice...hmm. Ugh this is ridiculous - as I'm writing this I'm watching emacs videos. I should just play computer games and ignore all this. I've wasted a quiet morning by myself on pointlessness.
