If I want to use the mac more, then I should move it to the main computer area and then I'd use it. Daughter is on the other computer so I'm using it today. I definitely think a single monitor would be better. I just hate selling old monitors - no-one really wants to spend that much and shipping them is a real hassle. Trying to sell local means I get nothing for it. I suppose I could just keep them in case of something later and put them in the attic. The Apple Cinema ought to get a decent price as it's Apple. Sort of makes me want to get an Apple 27" Thunberbolt display, however, they seem to cost more than a new Dell 27" and the Dell is probably better. I don't need the magsafe charging so would be a waste.

Someone bought the broken trackpad from me. People will buy anything.

After I don't know how long, okay I looked it up, I started this 31st October, so nearly 2 months ago, I'm opening back up Head First Javascript book. I'm sat at the mac, and it's open! On to Chapter 2...

Trying to find that date on this site was impossible, the wiki, however, made it very easy! Okay, I'm just distracting myself with this. I should promise to stop talking about this and never do it again. I guess I'll give myself until the end of the year then I don't want to hear about should I write in x or y ever again. This site is just like a river. You side beside it and enjoy watching it go past but once it's gone you don't try and go searching through it. If you look away, so be it. The river flows and that's that. If you're really dedicated I suppose you can drive further downstream and pick up what you missed.

Rather than spending 20 hours learning about Tinderbox, surely I should spend that time learning emacs or vim.
