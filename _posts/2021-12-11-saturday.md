I remember when I wanted to blog more and I'd set myself the target of one post per week. A month would go by, so I would change the target to one a month. A year would go by and I'd make the same New Year's resolution to do one post a week. 

Now I'm doing one a day!? It does feel like a bit of a burden though. Someone's site I visited they wrote weekly updates. Similar in style and format to this but on a weekly level. 

I should stop writing about writing about.
