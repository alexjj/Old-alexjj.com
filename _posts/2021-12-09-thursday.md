Started setting up the [articles](/articles/) section of this site. It's not in the navigation yet as I still want to do more things. They're going to be more traditional blog posts, which I write very infrequently. However, whilst making it I realised that I should perhaps have made these daily notes to be a separate collection and the normal blog posts the default. Just as things like tags and "out of the box stuff" are all setup towards them by default. It would also be a chance to move these daily posts into a folder structure so there's not so many in the explorer. No doubt that'll add more complexity though.

The [multiverse](https://multiverse.plus/alexjj/) is a weird blogging/community site.
