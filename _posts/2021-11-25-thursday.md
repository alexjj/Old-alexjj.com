[You’re a lazy git.](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)

The best sales this Black Friday are always VPS! [Lowendbox](https://lowendbox.com/) and [lowendtalk](https://lowendtalk.com/) have the best deals. The problem is there’s so many it’s hard to know what to get. Often things are [limited availability](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/175211/2021-black-friday-cyber-monday-official-megathread-flash-deals#latest) so you have to commit before seeing what else there is. Last few years I’ve bought from [inception hosting](https://inceptionhosting.com/limited-offers.html), they’ve always been reliable and decent, so tempted to upgrade my current VPS to their latest €15/year VPS and be done with it. I’d get more storage and bandwidth for the same price. If I buy it now, it gives me a little bit of time to transfer my services across before the existing one shuts down.
