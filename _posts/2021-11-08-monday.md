[What a cool outliner web app…especially if you like/know vim.](https://github.com/WuTheFWasThat/vimflowy)

I remembered a really good article about something today that I know I’d “saved” for later. Now that I want to find it I don’t remember where I saved it. Or if I did in fact save it directly or save the route I took to find it. I think I found it via a comment on reddit, or maybe it was a comment on a blog…hmm…
