## Desktop

Getting on a bit now, i5 2500K Sandy Bridge, 16GB RAM, SSD, Radeon 580. Newish 32" HP Omen 1440p 75Hz monitor. Keyboards...That needs a new page!

## Laptop

Thinkpad X230 with Arch Linux, XFCE

## Server

Lenovo TS140 ThinkStation, i3, 32GB RAM and 4x 4TB WD Red. Running Arch Linux and ZFS. For a couple of years I ran FreeBSD.

## Mobile

Work gives me an iPhone SE. Have a LG G3 kicking about too.

## Photography

![X100F](/images/x100f.jpg)
Use a Fuji X100F when we're travelling or I want a discrete/lightweight camera. Have a Nikon D7200 for all other times. 

## Others

A couple of Raspberry Pis about. One acting as DNS via [pi-hole](https://pihole.net), the other varies between RetroPie emulator box, and general purpose linux box.

I really like my Kindle Paperwhite. I started a list of the [books]({filename}books.md) I've read.

### Previous Hardware

#### Laptops:

* Thinkpad X201s
* Dell XPS circa ~2008


#### Computers

First, and previous server was a HP Microservr NL40, with 4x2 TB drives running Ubuntu server, then later Arch Linux. Tried out FreeNAS but prefered linux.
