I've named it the darkness. At first I was going to call it the black darkness, but that doesn't really make any sense.

The first time I found it, I'd gone walking in the woods in the evening. It was still light, being in June and fairly far north, but the drizzle was strong. It's interesting how a drizzle can be strong without actually being rain. The droplets are small but stablised such that they don't coalesce to form regular rain. I was quite wet on the outside.

I wandered about, following paths and fence lines. Some people's gardens back onto the forest and are just open at the ends. Deer run freely between finely cut grass and random trees and bushes. Running through a section are these power lines. It is on one side of these that the darkness is contained.

I was walking along having just crossed the power line path when I stopped to look. There was a change in the trees and their density.
