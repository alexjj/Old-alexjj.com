After playing Breath of the Wild on the Switch, I wondered what it would take to play through all the old Zelda titles. I've never played any of them before and so what better way to spend my limited free time than playing through a whole load of old games :) Turns out you can pretty much play every single game with just a 3DS and a Wii U. Taking advantage of the eShop titles as well as original content on those devices. I already own a 3DS so this looks promising.

Here's the breakdown:

### Wii U

* Legend of Zelda (WiiU eShop)
* Legend of Zelda II: Adventure of Link Legend of Zelda (WiiU eShop)
* A Link to the Past Legend of Zelda (WiiU eShop)
* Ocarina of Time (64 version, not the 3DS update, WiiU eShop)
* Majora's Mask (64 version, not 3DS update, on Wii eShop -- requires you booting into Wii mode to buy and play)
* Wind Waker HD (disc or WiiU eShop)
* Minish Cap (WiiU eShop)
* Twilight Princess (Wii version, disc only)
* Skyward Sword (disc only)

### 3DS

* Legend of Zelda (eShop)
* Adventure of Link (eShop)
* Link's Awakening DX (Gameboy Color version of the Gameboy title, eShop)
* Ocarina of Time 3D (eShop or game cart)
* Majora's Mask 3D (eShop or game cart)
* Oracle of Ages (eShop)
* Oracle of Seasons (eShop)
* Four Swords (if you downloaded it during it's limited availability; this was a small multiplayer game that was part of the GBA port of Link to the Past)
* Phantom Hourglass (DS, cart only)
* Spirit Tracks (DS, cart only)
* A Link Between Worlds (eShop or cart)

Now the question is *which one first?*. There's lots of debate online as to which to start with and what order to play them. Some say do them in release order others focus on the top ones, and others suggest switching up between 2D and 3D or old vs. new so as not to get burn out!

Ones that appear a lot in these lists are:

* A Link Between Worlds
* A Link to the Past
* Ocarina of Time

Given I don't have a Wii U, then probably going to be A Link Between Worlds. Although there's always emulation...
