By chance I happened to notice the boys passports are expiring in a few months. Good job I did as our next attempt at going to France wouldn't have been very successful if they aren't renewed. The slickness of the online system, even online photo codes from a passport photo store is very nice. No more forms or waiting or messing about.

Recently I've been wondering about this site, and whether or not to continue it. I suppose I'll just leave it up and add to it whenever, but recently I've felt like there's nothing much to say.
