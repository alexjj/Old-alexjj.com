[Two threads talking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/sanxen/honest_oppinion_is_the_leica_glass_worth_it/) about if Leica glass "is worth it". Focused on M mount glass. I like my Voigtlander 35mm f1.4 II MC and don't think I'd notice the difference with the Leica equivalent. Still trying to pick up at least one Leica lens, just because, and the 90mm seems the most likely. Although I may give up given the limited availability of nice ones in the UK, and just get the new CV 90mm!

Everyone has tested positive now, so it'll be a fun week of all the kids at home.

YouTube keeps reminding me of all the Tinderbox guide videos I've not watched. Is it trying to help me or taunt me?

I'm enjoying my old, revitalised static gallery. Been looking back at all the old photos. Also makes me want a X100 series camera again. Some of them I noticed where I'd put the files through Lightroom vs. just straight out of camera. Usually it was Auto, then maybe medium contrast curve or some setting like that. Back with my Nikon I used Punch preset a lot. Not sure if I still like the look but it does help prevent the images looking flat. I've noticed that Apple Photos Auto doesn't tend to do very much. Not sure if that's a good thing or not.
