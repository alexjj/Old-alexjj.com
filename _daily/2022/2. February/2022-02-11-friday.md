It's been a while since I've had a morning off and all the kids are in school. I don't know what to do with myself! Tidied and dusted the camera shelf and the office. It's not noticeably tidier but it's better. I looked at my list of potential projects or things that I started but never got very far. Such as learning javascript, and website readjustments or using that e-ink screen. None of them are really that appealing to actually do.

Been playing Path of Exile with a friend. The game is quite old now, 2013 release date, but still holds up well. It's often referred to as the truer sequel to Diablo 2. There's a lot more customisation possible compared to Diablo 3. We played it in May 2020 and each time I think it'll be a great game to play as there's so much end game content it'll keep us entertained for ages. Yet I'm sure we'll get there then realise it's just infinite grinding for incrementally smaller and smaller improvements. So we stop. The journey is fun though.
