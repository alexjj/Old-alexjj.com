Bought my first Leica lens! 90mm Tele-Elmarit f/2.8. Looked in mint condition and seemed like a good price...for this lens. Be excited to try it out.

Been using TW a lot for work but feeling like a need something more. Finding I have so many random ideas or tasks or things that I'm not capturing somewhere. Always find this with new roles, everything is new it feels like so much to take in and I'm not used to it. Whereas something I've done for ages I can just listen and I know what to do without issues.

Tempted to switch to Logseq, for inline tagging and todos maybe. Although there's quite a lot of functionality with Loqseq that I feel like I need to learn before I start using it else it'll be somewhat messy.

Last time I thought about this, I decided it wasn't worth the hassle and I'll just keep using tiddlywiki and a notebook. Maybe I should stick to that thought.
