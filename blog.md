# November 2021

* November 25

    * [You’re a lazy git.](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)

    * The best sales this Black Friday are always VPS! [Lowendbox](https://lowendbox.com/) and [lowendtalk](https://lowendtalk.com/) have the best deals. The problem is there’s so many it’s hard to know what to get. Often things are [limited availability](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/175211/2021-black-friday-cyber-monday-official-megathread-flash-deals#latest) so you have to commit before seeing what else there is. Last few years I’ve bought from [inception hosting](https://inceptionhosting.com/limited-offers.html), they’ve always been reliable and decent, so tempted to upgrade my current VPS to their latest €15/year VPS and be done with it. I’d get more storage and bandwidth for the same price. If I buy it now, it gives me a little bit of time to transfer my services across before the existing one shuts down.

* November 24

    * Drummer is awesome. So I made [awesome drummer](https://github.com/alexjj/awesome-drummer). Share your links, guides and blogs!

* November 23

    * I want to buy the Elder Scrolls: Skyrim for Nintendo Switch. It’s on sale but I don’t know why I want to. It’s a 10 year old game, I already own the game on PC, and it’s still not exactly cheap given it’s so old. If it sells, of course they’re going to try and get the most money they can for it. It does come with the DLCs and maybe it’s been improved since the original in terms of bugs and whatever. Like most gaming these days, I have fond memories of playing games but I actually find them boring to play. I know I shouldn’t buy it, yet I still keep thinking about it. I suppose once this week is over the sale will end and I’ll move on to something else.

    * Using macOS again

        * I’ve been critical of Apple and macOS in the past, and I’ve not used a Mac in years. That changed recently and now I have a Mac and am using macOS. The more I use it, the more I appreciate the details in it. Everything is unified in a much tighter and nicer way than Windows or Linux. I think GNOME or KDE on Linux does a decent job of it, or if you live entirely within emacs, but as a mainstream desktop OS, macOS is enjoyable. I do have some Windows/Linux-isms to unlearn or perhaps is macOS-isms to learn.

        * Finder is a bit odd - why can’t I press enter to open a directory? It actually is an outline, and pressing ⌘ Command + ↓ Down Arrow navigates to the level below. There’s probably other stuff but I’ve forgotten it or looked it up. Using ⌘+C/V for copy and paste is going to be the biggest complaint from the family if I setup the main computer to be the Mac. Yes they can learn, but they don’t use the computer enough to appreciate everything else to understand why they should learn.

            * Seems like it annoyed someone enough they [wrote some software](http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/) to fix these things!

        * The integration obviously goes a long way if you’re in the Apple ecosystem. So it makes so much sense to use the stock apps too. Which is something else I now appreciate. Stock apps - that are good and useful! Windows what do you offer? A few things but nowhere near as good. Of course Linux has the upper hand in terms of available software (of course much of it runs on other OSs too) but there’s not always the integration.

        * Anyway, I’m enjoying it and no, it’s not all open source, but whatever. 🤷🏼‍♂️

* November 22

    * Another thing I wondered about was old posts. It appears oldschoolblog renders a month maybe. There’s no “more” or “previous” link. I’ve got my simple links to previous months in my about page. I can find content whilst in Drummer but other readers accessing the main site cannot. I also wondered does it matter or do I care. 🦶

    * I’d like a nice way to enter block code or inline code, block quotes and lists. Just like adding a link is clicking the button or Italics is a shortcut key. Now if markdown is the best way to implement it, then great. Maybe best is the wrong word, but a practical way that works and is reasonably memorable. I suppose a script could do some text manipulation or something, but I’m never going to do that. 👨‍💻

* November 20

    * The new (to me) Mac mini arrived, 2012 i7 model. Also came with a 23” Apple Cinema Display. Which is cool but it gets boiling and only one input is annoying with multiple computers. Not sure what I’ll do with that. Coming back to macOS after \~7 years takes a bit of getting used to. There’s a lot to setup and I feel like a lot of tricks to learn.

* November 18

    * [“The best thing about the Ricoh GR IIIx is that it’s basically just a GR III with a slightly longer lens. The worst thing about the Ricoh GR IIIx is that it’s basically just a GR III with a slightly longer lens.” There was a lovely sunrise this morning which the iPhone wouldn’t be able to capture, maybe the APS-C wouldn’t either, but it was another reminder of how a pocketable, high performance camera would be a great thing to have.](https://www.dpreview.com/opinion/4617817917/family-reunion-shooting-with-the-ricoh-gr-iiix-on-a-trip-home-to-england)

    * I do like all these new Cosina Voigtländer vintage design lenses they’re [coming out with](https://www.dpreview.com/news/5368388976/cosina-announces-its-updated-vintage-line-21mm-f3-5-lens-set-for-december-release). I feel like I should get at least one Leica lens but the quality, performance and price of the CVs it’s hard to justify Leica.

    * Kentmere 400 + 2

    * Had two rolls of Kentmere 400 developed. One at box speed, and one pushed two stops. At box speeds its quite a grainy film stock, I’ll have to dig out some HP5 photos to compare but seems similar to that. What was interesting was at ISO 1600 the grain appeared no worse! Certainly on casual viewing, probably there are some differences at 100%. So whilst I wasn’t that excited about it at 400, I’m very impressed with it at 1600. Could be a good B&W stock for the winter months when I’m even looking for 1600 whilst outside! These photos were from a few weeks ago [where I was kicking myself](https://alexjj.com/2021/10/24/210200.html?title=Film%20ISO%20fails) from being poorly organised. However, even with the disorganisation the photos turned out really well. Although I’m not sure I’ve had a film photos that (as long as it was in focus) that I didn’t love.

* November 17

    * Drummer fiddling

        * Somehow I didn’t notice when this appeared, or maybe it was already there, but tags with `[[tag]]` 👉 \[\[drummer-meta\]\] 👈are possible. Although they don’t seem to actually work…okay excitement over.

        * sabre23t maintains a [nice list of drummer users](http://scripting.com/code/concordreader/?url=http://drummer.scripting.com/sabre23t/otherdrummers.opml). There’s also Andy’s [old school drummers river](http://oldschooldrummers.andysylvester.com/) to see their posts.

        * Drummer has markdown support ([I’ve definitely not been paying attention](http://drummer.scripting.com/cluelessnewbie/blog.opml))

            * But I can’t figure out how to get it to work…

            * Code block

###### Four spaces?

###### The the clueless blog opml appeared to only have one.

            * Doesn’t render the purple # under a markdown node.

            * Not sure why I need it, maybe the headers would be nice when I want a few layers. The code block css is nicer than using code block attributes (which I’ve forgotten what they are) in drummer

* November 16

    * I was plesantly surprised how well my blog.opml imported into dynalist. Node attributes don’t work, so link nodes and image nodes. Links which are inline are fine.

    * Now this is the kind of [IDE extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonybaloney.vscode-pets) I need.

* November 15

    * I’m always a sucker for new static site generators. This one,📜[Scroll](https://scroll.pub/), I found today was interesting. Mostly the layout, of which an interesting demonstration is this [trees site](https://treebase.treenotation.org/treedb/). A bigger site is [here](https://breckyunits.com/index.html). Maybe it’s a little overwhelming…

    * Gitpod - a new way to work across devices

        * What has been a more interesting discovery is [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/). It’s a container-based development platform, provisioning dev environments, even running code and previewing the output in the same window. Think I need to watch the [screencast series](https://www.gitpod.io/screencasts) to really understand what can be done. It appears you can get all the fun of VS Code (and even open the gitpod project in you local VS Code instance) and a server to run it on just from pre-pending `gitpod.io/#` to your Github (or Gitlab/bitbucket) URL.

            * This does come with [VS Code releasing a web version](https://vscode.dev/) of it.

        * This could be a nice way to manage a static site generator, or a personal plain text log system. It’s all on the same environment, you can access it anywhere with a browser - so no worrying about mobile devices, syncing between computers or any of that. Everything is backed up on github. VS Code does allow you to do all this already, however, you now get a server to run things on too. There’s so many things you can do with this.

        * Must be some limit to the free service…the [pricing page](https://www.gitpod.io/pricing) gives you 50 hours/month.

* November 14

    * If I’m honest, this is the office setup I aspire to.

    * Turns out using Apple’s dictation button on the keyboard, which is present in every app you type in, is a pretty nice way to add voice dictation to anything whatsoever! I like how it goes back and adjusts its transcript (to make it better/correct) when you speak more. It’s also interesting that sometimes I don’t correct it as it’s written what I’ve said slightly better

* November 13

    * [I like going to static gen lists, sorting by oldest and reliving code from the ages.](https://staticsitegenerators.net/)

* November 12

    * Upgraded my VPS to bullseye

    * Oracle’s free VM tiers are nice, but I worry they are too good to be true and will disappear…like how google cloud’s free vms (well free ipv4) disappeared. You can still get a free VM from Google Cloud but no ipv4. Which isn’t *that* much of a big deal as you can use cloudflare’s proxy to get around it but it’s just another thing and that might not be useful for everything.

* November 9

    * If I tried a little harder I could put my whole life in [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/). And it would be great.

* November 8

    * [What a cool outliner web app…especially if you like/know vim.](https://github.com/WuTheFWasThat/vimflowy)

    * I remembered a really good article about something today that I know I’d “saved” for later. Now that I want to find it I don’t remember where I saved it. Or if I did in fact save it directly or save the route I took to find it. I think I found it via a comment on reddit, or maybe it was a comment on a blog…hmm…

* November 7

    * A deal for a mATX motherboard almost sucked me into buying a new computer. Mine is old, 3rd gen Ivy Bridge CPU, but it still functions just fine. I still sort of want a Mac, but I also like Linux and value for money. For a while I was very pro-open source software, particularly Operating Systems. I still am but I still use Windows on my main machine. I have decided that when (if) we redo the kitchen, I’ll get an iMac as a family computer. It’s the ideal device for a family area.

    * Enjoyed some good fireworks this [bonfire weekend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night). I think this year’s was our most efficient ever. Literally as we found ourselves a good spot to stand, the fireworks started.

    * I tried taking some photos in the dark with the X-T2, and pushed the ISO to 12,800. On the camera’s LCD they looked okay, less so on the monitor. I should print one out and see how it looks. Thought about the monochrom cameras being ideal for this situation. Then remembered the prices.

* November 6

    * Kids don’t know how easy they have it these days with SSL from Let’s encrypt. One line `sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain` and it does everything for you. Even edits your nginx config where it finds the domain to add all the SSL certs and recommended settings to secure a strong rating. I remember when startssl (I think) began offering one free SSL cert per year. You’d have to go through various hoops to prove yourself and then download the certification, upload it to your server and then figure out all the settings. There was a [gist somewhere](https://gist.github.com/konklone/6532544) that had recommended settings and generating your own dhparam key and everything. Now just install nginx and certbot and away you go. Scores an A on [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).

    * If you’re after a new VPS this month then wait until black friday/cyber monday and have a look on [lowendtalk](https://www.lowendtalk.com/), always lots of great deals (in fact too many). I’ve picked up great VPSs over the years for \~\$15/**year** that have all run perfectly for my self-hosted sites. [Inception hosting](https://inceptionhosting.com/) is one of my favourites, [Virmach](https://virmach.com/) have been good too. I’m looking for a new photo gallery hosting site to upgrade my \$4/yr OpenVZ VPS special 😅

    * Playing around with [PhotoFloat](https://github.com/alexjj/photofloat) again, and I do like static gen websites. It’s python2 but still makes a nice site. I currently use Piwigo for gallery website, which is a great piece of software, but has lots of features I don’t really care about. However, their hosted service with unlimited storage is nice for big photo collections.

    * [For anyone who likes loqseq but can’t spend all hours of the day on the discord (annoyingly where most of the good content goes) someone else does this for you in a mailing list.](https://logseqweekly.com/)

    * …and whilst I’m on this logseq detour here’s the [awesome list](https://github.com/logseq/awesome-logseq).

    * [Oh now this is cool! A telegram bot for your loqseq…](https://github.com/akhater/Lupin#features)

    * I sold my Fujifilm X100F after not using it for a long time. Now I want to use it.

    * Surely the solution to this ”[tools for thought](https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/5)” problem is emacs? It’s been looking for a good editor for ages. I’m not sure importing opml files into other tools really helps any more than just adding a search function to the rendered html. These other tools have a benefit due to the additional meta data the user adds - e.g. linking, tags, filters, queries, macros, etc. I suppose these unlinked references might be of use, but dumping a whole heap of data into the tool, then looking at all those unlinked references would be a bit overwhelming. If you want to replace its editor, then drummer needs to support the extra stuff. I love blogging with drummer but logseq’s editor has a lot of nice features I wish drummer had…Now I want to try logseq again and see where it’s got to…

    * I should resist the temptation to get sucked into [Jack’s Tinderbox tinkering](https://baty.blog/2021/11/04/223120.html?title=myNeglectedTinderboxDaybookFor2021#a224022). It looks nice though… 😬

    * Division 

        *  I think that I shall never envision An op unlovely as division. An op whose answer must be guessed And then, through multiply, assessed; An op for which we dearly pay, In cycles wasted every day. Division code is often hairy; Long division’s downright scary. The proofs can overtax your brain, The ceiling and floor may drive you insane. Good code to divide takes a Knuthian hero, But even God can’t divide by zero!

    * Great Bustard

    * Been watching some videos on [Rocketbook](https://getrocketbook.co.uk/), this seems like it could be what I’m after to help with [my challenge](https://alexjj.com/2021/11/04/115353.html?title=The%20longevity%20of%20physical%20notebooks,%20and%20their%20content). If nothing else it’s a cheap experiment. In fact, they offer printable templates to try out first - so free!

    * This [Github integration and Github actions conversation](https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/3) is very exciting. It’s on my todo list to figure out and experiement with but I never get round to it, hopefully one of these chaps can figure it all out 😄

    * I (re)remembered the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). That’ll be another good intention that I’ll never furfill.

    * [Magic: The Gathering is turing complete.](https://fermatslibrary.com/s/magic-the-gathering-is-turing-complete)

    * The longevity of physical notebooks, and their content

        * The other day I was tidying my office. The clutter had slowly grown and it had become too annoying. I also had a bunch of things to do that I was putting off, like scanning some letters, storing boxes of (yet more) stuff I’d bought as well as just the tidy up itself. I had a stack of notebooks, a mix of Leuchturms, moleskins, random brands, but all about A5 size. I use these every day at work to track my weekly and daily to-dos, notes from meetings and general paper scratchpad for calcs or ideas. This stack probably went back to about 2018. What was I going to do with them?

        * I probably spent a good 20 minutes just flicking through the pages - this is something I love about physical notebooks. The ease of rediscovery of previous entries. I’ve not found a digital equivalent that’s quite so enjoyable. The “on this day” feature that many photo and journal apps have is nice but it’s just that day. There’s sometimes open a random entry or but the flicking through large time ranges and just having things jump out is much better.

            * Although if I’m honest, whilst it’s nice to do, it tends not to yield anything other than a brief moment reminiscing about that particularly entry. It’s definitely not a good way to manage work or organise important information.

        * At work, I always have my notebook with me. It’s very quick to capture anything, I also think it’s perceived as less rude than taking out a laptop. Pretty much as everyone thinks you’re not paying attention whilst writing notes on it. Now of course I shouldn’t care what other people think, but sometimes it *isn’t* appropriate to take out a laptop. I also have a nice routine of weekly planning, and daily planning in my notebook. That’s worked well for me for several years now and I shouldn’t really change that.

        * The bulk of entries are transient, stuff that needed to be done that week, meetings about it, updates, which whilst important at the time, the information tends to become meaningless over time. However, within it are useful items - what did I accomplish, updates and records of long running projects, and good reference information that I’ve captured. It is this information that I’m wondering about.

        * I’ve managed to get into a good habit of summarising my weekly achievements and capturing that in a private Tiddlywiki file. The habit is not entirely mine as my boss asks for the updates each week so that makes me do it, I suppose the putting it into TW is mine. I think there’s more improvements I can do in TW to make the information more convenient but generally it’s good enough. I have to do this summary as part of my work, so it gets done.

        * The obvious solution to saving this other important information is to extract it from the notebooks and into something more permanent, and probably something digital for longer term storage and searching. Maybe Tiddlywiki as it’s a pretty nice application, very customisible and has a good long term viability. The problem is getting the data into it. It’s going to take more time to do it, and time is always limited. There’s probably a whole host of systems and methods and I’m sure I can spend many hours figuring out systems and tools and maybe even buying stuff. In fact, I’m sure I’ll convince myself that buying stuff is the right solution - ranging from eye-watering eink notebooks like [reMarkable](https://remarkable.com/) or [Supernotes](https://supernote.com/), to more reasonable [rocketbooks](https://getrocketbook.co.uk). I’m just not sure if they really solve the problem or just give me the feeling that I’m solving it. I don’t really need to buy anything, but I suppose the arguement would be that if it saves me time then that’s the value it brings.

            * Anyway I suppose thoughts and review of those products are beyond what I started off typing about.

        * Whilst I think about the future, I looked at all the notebooks and decided just to recycle them. They probably have useful information in them but it’s too late now.

    * Red-billed oxpecker

    * I feel like iOS 15’s display of the number of Safari tabs I have open on my phone is a constant judgement of me.

    * Jailbreaking a kindle

        * Spent last night jailbreaking my older Kindle Paperwhite. This was kicked off by my desire to be able to pull out my highlights in a more automated manner on books that aren’t purchased from Amazon - which is quite a lot more me. I’d found [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) online and this appeared to have some automation potential with Joplin syncing, Calibre syncing or even just a SSH server on it.

        * The jailbreaking is very easy, and you just follow a series of steps from the [forums](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=320564). It installs KUAL (Kindle Unified App Launcher), this adds a button/book that you can launch from the normal Amazon system. You keep all the same Amazon library, store, options as well which is nice. Seems like you have to be wary of OTA upgrades from Amazon which can break your jailbreak. There’s some workarounds but looks like newer firmware is making it harder and harder. My kindle is quite old and I don’t think it’ll get any more firmware updates. They recommend putting it into Airplane mode when you don’t need the internet.

            * Airplane mode defeats my purpose of remotely pulling the highlights…

        * I played about with KO Reader last night, instead of reading, and it has lots of features and customisations which are nice. I probably won’t use many of them so not sure for me if it’s worth it.

            * Being able to rotating to landscape is a nice feature though. Again, probably won’t use it.

        * I think I’m just going to use my Tiddlywiki to capture my notes, so the Joplin sync is probably too complex. Calibre might be a good way to go. I don’t currently have it on my server, but probably not hard. I’ve never invested much time into Calibre, other than to covert epubs to mobi for kindle. However, it would be a nice way to organise my books. If I took my kindle with me, then the news feature would be good too. I think I read somewhere I can sync highlights with Calibre and then look at them there. Not sure if that’s helpful or not. I can open it and copy and paste but it adds formatting I don’t want even when copied as plain text. I wonder if the server version gives access to the highlights.

            * It does mean they’re all in one place. I’m sure someone else on the internet has solved this problem.

        * Then there’s SSH. Basically could script my server to download the highlights from the kindle automatically. Not sure if SSH is only running when the kindle is on or when asleep too. This is probably the best way if I’m going to automate syncing of highlights. However, I don’t just want a copy, process and file away system as I’ll never use it. Some interaction for reviewing the highlights, editing, picking, adding other notes etc. is important. It also risks spending more time automating a tiny part of it versus reviewing. I think it’s between this and Calibre.

        * I did end up quitting KO Reader and going back to normal kindle to keep reading my book (as the place is saved). KO Reader was just the first thing I tried and maybe it’s not what I want. I should have a look at the other plugins and see what else can be done.

        * The jailbreaking is a bit of a faff, and makes me think a Kobo might be better from the start. I used to jailbreak my iPhone back in the day and installed lots of things and always did the dance during iOS updates. When I had Android phones I’d install custom ROMs and root them. In the end it was too much hassle and I have better things to do.

        * I don’t want to lose sight of *actually* reading books.

    * I shouldn’t read non-fiction in bed before going to sleep. I read things and think this is amazing and I should do something about this. Maybe I highlight it on the kindle. Then I go to sleep and wake up and completely forget about it all. I don’t actually even get the benefits of kindle highlights as I don’t often buy books from Amazon. I buy them elsewhere (or they’re free) and I load them onto the kindle. So the highlights just sit in the text file on the device. Of course I could connect it to the computer, download the file and parse it (there’s probably many scripts online to do this for me already). THEN I could benefit from it. This is never going to happen. If I could ssh or remotely connect to the kindle then I could sync stuff. Perhaps that’s worth some research. Or maybe a different ebook reader is for me. OR maybe I should read non-fiction at another time, but then that conflicts with other stuff I do (like what? What do you do? Watch YouTube videos and browse used cameras+lenses that I don’t need).

    * I’m sorry, is this some kind of old hardware I’m too bloated to run on?

    * But in all seriousness, I’m not buying a new computer for Windows 11. Although I do *want* to buy a new computer. In fact I find it quite curious that I, as a computer aficionado, does actually only have pretty old computers. There’s a few of them about but the youngest is probably the T450s ThinkPad with 5th gen intel. Windows 11 might run on it, but it’s happily running GNU+Linux and my daughter uses it for her school work and so I don’t have to worry about it. The others are 3rd and 4th gen intel cpus. For the past 5-6 years I’ve been “buying a new computer”. The problem is nothing seems right, and I don’t want to buy something that I’ll be annoyed with. It is a little bit of *don’t let perfect is the enemy of good* but my current computer isn’t actually that slow - they are probably “slow” (benchmarks puts the new Ryzens about 3x the multithreaded performance) but nothing that has become annoying. I suspect if I used a newer computer I’d notice the difference but right now I’m ignorant to it. I used to upgrade my computer frequently, I feel like back (\~2000s) then it made a noticeable difference. I also used to play a lot of computer games and so a newer graphics card was always on the menu. I still play a few games but it’s getting less and less often. I’m to the point that I should just not bother with a “gaming” computer as all that happens is I buy a game and then never play it. I like the idea of computer games but I just have no interest anymore. Every so often a few friends will get something and we’ll play it together. That is a lot of fun but mostly as it’s us all chatting together. Sometimes I think about going Apple, although the SSD tax is eye watering, and then I think about all Linux (and very occasionally some maddness over OpenBSD), or just get a laptop and be done with all desktops and computers and make the office a reading and writing room. I can’t quite go without any computer or just iPad but sometimes I feel like the computer takes over too much of my life. But then I’m conflicted as I want to learn programming stuff…so yeah. I’ll just continue window shopping.

        * The compute module 4 has opened up so many options for tiny NASs. The RPi 4 is decent, and think it would be fine for media transcoding - which is my most demanding task. I’d like to replace my current server with a small, SSD only one. Maybe the PI is the answer. Although probably a refurb Lenovo or Dell with a SATA riser and a bunch of SSDs just kicking about inside would be a lot faster, less ARM hassle and maybe even cheaper.

    * I have 31 pages left in my Leuchtturm1917 notebook. Last week I used 9 pages, this week so far I’m on page 4. At best I can scrape my way to the start of December but not sure I’ll make it to Christmas. Would be nice to end the year in this notebook. Not that I ever go back and look in them, they sit on my desk but I start to forget what was in it and so don’t look. I always start off trying to use the index but often there are 30 page gaps or I just stop. I suppose I’m not making useful entries? I always want to be more organised but find I just get away with remembering things, googling, searching old emails, or flicking back though my current notebook. I have a very small tiddlywiki for work which does work well…when I remember to update it. [Yesterday](https://alexjj.com/2021/10/26.html#a182206) I was all about drummer for work but I’m not sure the tool is the issue. Thinking about an e-ink notebook is an (other vain?) attempt at trying to be more organised. The [supernote](https://supernote.com/) one has options for tags and table of contents or something, but that’ll still rely on me using them when I write stuff down.

Would be nice to have them as plain text files that software can use to generate a site vs. a database.

    * Programmatically upload to Drummer

        * After seeing the [URL to download your files](https://alexjj.com/2021/10/26.html#a114015), I reckoned a POST was possible to upload to Drummer. And sure enough, it is! In fact you can do many of the functions with post requests as that’s how the whole site works. Anyway, this is a starter to doing it yourself.

        * As far as I can tell you have to post your file’s contents to your special URL and sometimes `<head>` items can mess it up so for now I’ve removed all of mine. Some experimentation will probably let me work out what does and doesn’t work.

        * Unless it’s the same file every time, you’ll need to adjust the script so that you can reuse it with other files. For now this example is hardcoded. Here’s the code using python requests library:

            * [View Gist](https://gist.github.com/alexjj/8858e0be3136dc51a1ee9f8cd2bedd6a)

###### import requests

###### headers = {

###### response = requests.post(’http://drummer.scripting.com/publishfile’, headers=headers, params=params, data=opml_contents.encode(’utf-8’), verify=False)

        * [Curl is also possible to use](https://gist.github.com/alexjj/8bc3c25036dba59c5360e94cbf96cbce), but I’ve not tested the `--data-raw @filename` vs `--data-binary @filename` options in curl ([man page](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-d)), so it’s hard-coded contents of the opml file just now. If those don’t work then `cat` and bash can probably sort it out.

        * Why might you want to do this?

            * You can now create opml files offline, or in other apps, or via scripts (track the weather every day or server logs etc.) and then automate them being in drummer so you can work with them on the web, integrate into your blog or other files, or even use the data for drummer scripts.

            * You do have drummer’s own [scheduled scripting](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml#1628460028000) capabilities to pull data into it but that might not always work. It’s good to have options.

            * I’m not sure I know exactly what I want to do just yet, but it’s been a question of mine since I started using drummer.

    * Code blocks

        * [Dave explains how to add code blocks.](https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/100#issuecomment-952848765)

            * Add `flCodeSubs` attribute with value `true` to the parent headline.

        * So in this example below, I add the attribute to the Write Web page level. It’ll make everything under it code. I also had to escape the html in the code else it would render that. I just use escape the first \< using the html code & lt; (but no space, not sure how to escape the escape…!) and that’s enough to stop it rendering.

        * Write web page

            * const htmltext = “\<html>\<body>\<h1>Hello World!\</h1>\</body>\</html>”;

            * file.writeWholeFile (”hello.html”, htmltext);

            * const url = file.makeFilePublic (”hello.html”);

            * webBrowser.openUrl (url)

        * There is of course the option of embedding Gists: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://github.githubassets.com/assets/gist-embed-66dfe305c139be3761fc50dda387845f.css">`{=html}

    * Embedding Gists

        * Turns out embedding gists isn’t that straightforward. They work on the main page but if you go to the direct link then the page doesn’t render properly. It appears that the script html tags mess up the oldschoolblog processor and the page doesn’t get built correctly.

        * However, there’s a fix! Turns out the embed code for gists is just a small javascript wrapper for html and css. So you can get that and paste it into your blog and voila! it renders. [This chap](https://tosbourn.com/insert-gists-without-javascript/) has instructions of how to get the html from the javascript of your gist.

        * I find it works best if you put the first line, with the css link on the parent, and then the gist html as a child beneath it. That way you don’t get a blank line.

        * Like this.

* October 26

    * Been thinking about how I can get data into Drummer, particularly data I write on my phone as Drummer on my phone is..unpleasant. However there are other good apps, like dynalist and Zavala, for writing on phone. I don’t think there’s a way to push data into Drummer, unless the token in the download files button works to upload, but I could use the schedule to load a file from somewhere. The only caveat is that it has to be publicly available. OR I just import it manually when I have something to add. But I’d still like the ability to push data in for future ideas.

    * Why will none of our iPads update to iPadOS 15…

    * I keep a private tiddlywiki for work, but I’m considering a private outline in Drummer. I think having everything viewable in a single page would be more useful than a wiki. Something like Notion or Airtable might be good for work but they’re strict about posting information outside work network and I also can’t be bothered with all the faff of those tools. One big list is my preferred option, as it usually just ends up being weekly summaries or results. The big ‘+’ button makes it nice to add a day.

    * Jack has [wanted an improvement](%20%20https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Drummer%20Notes) to downloading his drummer outlines, and I would like it too if I started using private outlines more. I’d noticed the download link had a unique URL which meant I could likely access it directly outside of Drummer. I decided this lunchtime to have a little look and it does work. Here’s my [small python example](https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/63#issuecomment-951849007) but it’ll work with other languages too. *Update*: everyone else in the thread have posted great alternatives too. There’s one for everybody from Apple’s Siri, to serverless Zapier to unix server cron 🤩

    * Drummer Community

        * I wish there was a drummer community that wasn’t a couple of repos on github. There’s so many good tricks and tips, especially when you get into scripting, that people have shared on there but it’s all buried in issues.

            * I’ve thought about an awesome🕶 drummer repo and link to specific things but that becomes a burden. Maybe I’ll get distracted at work and add it 😅

        * Is there a way to see all Drummer users without being Dave?

        * I like [Andy’s drummer river](http://oldschooldrummers.andysylvester.com/), but it’s opt-in and I wouldn’t be surprised if most don’t know about it.

        * Perhaps I’m getting mixed up between micro.blog and drummer, and I’m not suggesting we get into @-ing each other (because we all have a twitter account to log in so could use that), but it would be nice to have a big feed of everyone’s drummer blog. They’re all public by nature. Maybe Dave would make a twitter list or river for us to use…or even just expose a list that we can parse. Update: [No.](https://fondoftea.com/#Drummer%20community)

    * So Obsidian has released [mobile apps](https://obsidian.md/mobile) now. For free. You can use iCloud sync or pay for their sync or maybe git via Working Copy. A quick test of it (on iPad) and the mobile app is very impressive, looks to have most, if not all, the features of the desktop app. Has a nice toolbar that you can customise, gestures to open command palette. I think I like it more than the desktop app! If you just use Apple products, it’s a pretty decent setup. If you paid for Publish it would make for a great experience. I just don’t like the desktop app nor want to pay \$192 / year for it. Probably if I looked someone has made a static html generator using your Obsidian notes. e.g. [1](https://github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link), [2](https://marco.kamner.eu/notes/technology/obsidian/publish-obsidian-to-personal-site/)

    * My blog banner is photo I took of the snow this year on HP5

    * I’ve come back to thinking I want a reMarkable (or similar) tablet again. I love paper notebooks to flick back through for some information but once I move to a new book this is impossible. Also like the idea of annotating/note taking from a book at the same time. Have to actually research how good it really is first. Seems Supernote might be better. Will take this research line over to the [wiki](https://fondoftea.com/#e-Ink%20Tablets).

    * Whilst looking up the name of the next *[Stormlight Archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive)* book to read, I found out about another epic fantasy series, [*Realm of the Elderlings* by Robin Hodd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hobb#The_Realm_of_the_Elderlings).

    * Submitted [a RFC](https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/2) for Drummer. I’d like to make some static pages. \[\[drummer-meta\]\]

    * When I’m away, I’m always so good at updating our family journal in DayOne. It’s because I’m not going on my (non-Apple) computer and instead using my iPad or phone so the app is right there. I want to print out our journal from America I kept in it. Only did about 2 years but would be nice to have. Something happened to some of the photos - probably the transition between old and new DayOne apps - but I did take a backup ages ago so they’re on my computer. I just need to go through each one and find the right day…I do have the json or whatever from the export so hopefully the photos are referenced in that and then I can at least skip straight to the right day. Not sure how to do this on my iPad…perhaps a combo of looking up the day on the computer from the journal text and then just adding the picture in the app on iPad. It’s a bit of a chore but would make a good christmas present for my wife. I told myself it would be a good anniversary present but too late for that now. I think DayOne books are from USA, so really need to order it in next couple of weeks. Unless I export pdf and have it printed locally…anyway need to do the photos. I’m also wondering if I should (or need to) edit the text, this will then take a lot longer.

    * Film ISO fails

        * The fun of film is fixing what you get for the next 24/36 shots. I suppose midway rewinds are possible but that’s just asking for trouble. The big choice is colour or black and white and then what ISO. There are other choices too but these are the main ones for me. ISO 400 is generally a good one for me as it let’s me just get away with f/1.4-f/2 with 1/60s indoors and outdoors it’s fine on overcast days. If it’s sunny then it would be nice to make use of (generally) finer grained ISO 200 or ISO 100 films. Gives the photos a smooth, crisp look. The problem is you don’t always know what you’re going to be shooting, how many frames you’ll use and how reliable the weather forecast is. A professional will mitigate these issues with multiple bodies or backs and probably take more photos than I would. This weekend was a particularly bad *series of unfortunate events*, and I was all over the place.

        * I’ve been wanting to try some different black and white stocks, and had some cheap Kentmere 400. I’d also brought some Kodak ColorPlus (again cheap!) which is ISO 200. The B&W was loaded first before we left and it was a beautifully sunny day. I used a whole roll without resorting to pointless shots, which is always nice, and didn’t bother loading another as we were about to leave. To be organised, I decided to load the ISO 200 colour film that night ready for the next day. Oh, how grey and dull and dark is was, even outside! Trying to take pictures at 1/50s f/1.4, or trying 1/30s knowing that there’s going to be movement. Clearly a flash or other light source would be helpful but I don’t have one that works with my film camera. Down at f/1.4 is also pushing my focusing when everyone is running around. Oh how I wished I’d waited until the morning to load the film…there’s a lesson for me…I could’ve pushed the film but I’m not confident cheap ColorPlus would handle that very well. I managed to use up the roll, maybe something can be salvaged from it.

            * I even considered just throwing it away, but you never know.

        * So back to another roll of Kentmere for the next day. It was more mixed in weather, plus I knew I’d be taking some photos inside. I’d also brought my digital camera and it’s easy to forget that it can easily push ISO 6,400 before it looks bad and in B&W ISO 12,800 even looks nice. Around the house it was 2500-3000 ish. So when I switch back to ISO 400, I realise this is still going to be tricky. So I decided I’ll meter it for ISO **1600**! +2 stops. Am I mad? The cheap stock pushed two stops?! Only one way to find out…We shall see how that goes. However, at 1600 I now have plenty of latitude and can start closing that aperature down a bit. So everything’s great…

        * We then decide to go out to [Loch Lomond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Lomond) and the clouds part and the sun comes streaming out. Which is lovely for the kids and everyone to enjoy it, but for me I’m now at f/16 and topping out on shutter speed on my camera! The scenery is of course beautiful and the autumn colours aren’t quite the same in black and white! Oh well!

        * On my digital camera, I was trying out some new fujifilm simulation settings - trying to get to just one colour and one black and white that I use 99% of the time to make it easier to decide - and the B&W one is way too bright on the highlights. Maybe I could’ve turned the exposure compensation down but it was only +1/3 or +2/3 at most. So now I either accept or delete a lot of those photos, or go and reprocess the raws.

    * [@Phil](https://youneedastereo.com/#2021-10-21%20Journal), we were one step away from finding your house and standing over you until you made a [Drummer blog](http://oldschool.scripting.com/twelvety/) :) Welcome! It took me a few days to figure it out, and I still use my Tiddlywiki, and it’s somewhat random what goes where, but the wiki tends to be more chatty, least at the moment. I’m intrigued you [find Drummer easier to use](http://oldschool.scripting.com/twelvety/2021/10/21.html#a151655) than Tiddlywiki on the phone. I can’t see anything when I open drummer on my phone, I turn it landscape but it’s all overflowing, but TW fits to the screen.

    * Took the boys for the their haircuts. The barber was a very strict Italian man who kept them sitting up straight the whole time. I enjoyed it.

    * Getting in the Hallowe’en mood with pumpkins, biscuits and decorations.

    * Drummer Tweaks \[\[drummer-meta\]\]

        * Noticed the tabs on drummer blogs don’t look very good when on mobile, I should look into the CSS to see if those can be a bit nicer.

        * Ended up removing the updated time at the top and letting the tabs’ size just go off the text. They’re all about the same size anyway so not that noticeable but it makes them much nicer on mobile.

            * Also offers room for a lot more!

        * Tidied up the about page a little

            * Using html headers seemed to make it add blank lines, so adopted a more outliner appropriate format 😁

            * Made the archives just Month links, will manually add those

        * Removed reference to the standalone page, I’ll still keep it in the outline so I don’t forget the syntax but commented out.

        * Looking at [Phil’s fresh blog](http://oldschool.scripting.com/twelvety/) made me wonder about having a very clean looking one with no tabs. A bit like how a [day](https://alexjj.com/2021/10/21.html) or [month view](https://alexjj.com/2021/10/) is.

            * Not sure about the…About page though. Would be nice to have that as this is now my main page. Unless I did a very small feature at the top, like a pinned post. The first post being a hard coded about.

            * The Links would be missing too but not so bothered about that. I’d just write an entry instead, which might be more meaningful. If the link is that good I’ll add it to the wiki. I’m not even sure I like that Radio3 posts to my twitter.

        * Got rid of the Twitter connect and version number. I don’t need it or bothered about other people tweeting my site.

        * The font awesome social icons in the footer just do not work for me whatsoever. Either weird symbols appear or only RSS depending on browser.

            * The CSS/js imports in the html template make it look like the kitchen sink is also rendered.

* October 20

    * If you want facebook, github or linkedin links at the bottom of your blog, add the following OPML headers: `ownerFacebookAccount`, `ownerGithubAccount`, `ownerLinkedinAccount` with your id.

    * Had to cut the lawn, although it’s been raining for weeks and it’s still wet, but I did it anyway. I usually listen to [talkpython.fm](https://talkpython.fm/) podcast but the most recent ones looked boring from my perspective. So I thought I’d search for [Dave Winer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer). I’d not really heard of him until I somehow got to know about Drummer (most likely via [Jack](https://baty.blog/)). I found [this one from Nov 2020](https://thisweekinstartups.com/e1133-podcast-blogging-pioneer-dave-winer-on-inventing-new-forms-of-media-tribalism-on-social-media-tales-of-the-golden-age-of-silicon-valley-more/). It’s fascinating to listen to the early days of the internet, and generally any of Dave’s stories from the early days of tech and silicon valley (including meeting with Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and others back in the early days). It was also during peak COVID lockdown.

    * I just added the [DW menu](https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/21) to Drummer and viewed the source. It’s a nice set of examples showing you what you can do.

    * It’s only been ages but I need to find a mask that doesn’t cause my glasses to steam up. My solution so far to this problem is to not go anywhere.

    * Drummer Blog Pages

        * `This is undocumented and may not be supported so use at your own peril.`

        * I’ve found how to add other pages to the blog. [See here](https://alexjj.com/archives.html) as an example.

        * I copied the opml and attributes from [this example](https://gist.github.com/scripting/3c9bcf62123d20c6001d087b8722a6d5).

        * The title is a link to something that doesn’t exist. Not sure what to do about that just now.

        * I also edited the CSS to hide the Page Post time that’ll appear at the top.

        * I’m thinking that I could use drummer scripting to generate some content then just dump it in this page all within drummer.

            * Admittedly the daily page urls are predictable: e.g. `2021/10/20.html`

            * It’s dancing around a proper archives implementation.

    * Drummer Blog Backups

        * Regardless of how good software is, something will break. Therefore it’s best to backup! \[\[drummer-meta\]\]

            * Reliable backup is complex and I’m not going to try and admit I’m an expert or even know anything about it. This is just the first steps I’ve taken

        * This is also focusing just on your blog, not other outlines you may have in Drummer.

        * Conveniently, when you make your `blog.opml` public, it’s exactly that. Public. This means you can download it at your leisure. Also true for About or other public outlines.

            * Yours will be `http://drummer.scripting.com/your-twitter-handle/blog.opml`

        * I have a [simple bash script](https://github.com/alexjj/drummer-blog/blob/main/backup.sh) that curl’s the file and commits it to a git repo and pushes to github. My computer runs it every 15 minutes via cron. Systemd timers also available.

        * This is also in the same repo that I host the template files and images, published via Github pages to use with Drummer. This is helpful to track changes to my CSS or template index.html, not that I’ve done very much so far.

        * [Dave shows you how to do](http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/11/190447.html?title=itsReallyEasyToBackUp) a really simple and easy backup of all your drummer outlines.

            * If you hover over that *Download my files* menu you’ll see a URL with tokens and secrets. No doubt that can be used to get the files too.

            * *UPDATE*: You can use this to automate downloading all your outlines. Check out this [Github Issue](https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/63) for examples.

        * The next step in this would be to use Drummer’s own [scripting tools](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml), even including [scheduled scripts](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml#1628460028000), together with `<insert backup system>`{=html}’s API to automate backup of your outlines.

* October 19

    * I should pay attention to this [style guide](http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/17/031157.html?title=styleNoteSingularItemsBeforeTitledItems). I was thinking time of day, not ease of understanding!

    * Fuji Film Simulations

        * I think it’s time I worked out my own ones. It’s only been 4 years of using Fuji and I’m yet to do it. Mostly just taken ones from online, such as [Fujix weekly’s](https://fujixweekly.com/fujifilm-x-trans-iii-recipes/), or other random places. Right now I have two that I use a lot, and two others that I occasionally use but then like them when I remember. The other 3 are just entries I have to jog over to get to what I want. I should also order them in how I want to use them. E.g. top is favourite colour, then favourite B&W, and last another favourite (as my custom button means I can press it then up or down to get to another custom settings).

        * The tethered FujiFilm X raw studio should be useful for this but requiring tethering is a bit of a pain. Last time I tried it got upset and stopped working or something equally frustrating. It does help me get the image on the big screen so I can see if Shadows needs another -1 or whatever.

            * Hmm…The needs a camera is usb 3 micro b cable…

        * Classic chrome is generally my favourite colour simulation, although sometimes it’s a little grungy for family photos. The classic neg in the newer camera models looks a bit nicer but I’m not buying a newer model for a film simulation.

            * The newer models do offer more customisation though…I’ll wait for the X-T5/6 to be released then maybe it’ll be time to get the X-T3 (assuming it has what I’m looking for).

        * Acros is by far my favourite black and white.

    * Trying out 27mm (eq.)

    * The lens focuses fast enough for me and my kids. Yes, it’s not the fastest lens but I’m not getting annoyed with it. It is my first day with it but enjoying it inside and outside.

    * Wondering if I should subscribe to smugmug or flickr or none…I wish Apple did more with Photostream web albums.

    * Film data imprinting

        * Several cameras offer the ability to imprint data on the film, such as time, date, but more interestingly is shutter speed and aperture. Most do it via a special back. I don’t want it on the photo (and I don’t want date/time) but between them.

        * The tricky part is finding available backs.

        * Minolta Dynax/Maxxum 7 has a data recorder on the camera. So no imprinting but saved for later retrieval via the menus. I guess that’s something, but I’d have to remember to write it out. Fortunately it saves 7 films so in my typical batch of 3-4 for development should be fine.

            * [Gary helps explain](https://www.friedmanarchives.com/minolta-maxxum-dynax-7/) why I want a 7.

    * I never use twitter (I did back in 2010 or something but then deleted my account after a few years). Sometimes I think I’m missing out but I don’t care.

* October 18

    * Analogue WonderLab

        * I ordered 2x B&W film development and scanning from [Analogue Wonderland](https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/collections/film-developing). They had a 20% off promo that ended last night. Even with the promo filmdev is cheaper for C-41.

        * If I had my own scanner then it might be worthwhile as you can do £6 development then scan myself, and that includes postage.

        * Eventually I’ll develop my own black and white. Not sure about colour.

        * Also started browsing black and white film stocks….there’s quite a lot which could be fun.

    * Sometimes I think about going all in with Apple: Macs, iPads, iCloud, Watch, Apple One subscription, AppleTV. Replace everything in the house with Apple. Think it would all work well but a lot of eggs in one very expensive basket.

    * [I actual lol’d](https://rudimentarylathe.org/2021/10/18/104607.html?title=theCameraSituation#a111806)

    * Still not sure where this site fits. It definitely doesn’t take over Tiddlywiki. It might take over my blog, but it’s a different type of blogging. It’s more like the short posts I do on the blog vs. the long ones. However, this blog would most likely be much more active that my current one. I could also capture the long posts that I want categorised in the wiki. OR I could keep both TW and the blog and *add* this as another blogging site. I’m thinking as my home domain, alexjj.com. That way I can still link to the blog for longer stuff I want to add (which I should also just make copies of in the wiki - or in fact draft them in the wiki) and then have the wiki for random gibbering, plus wiki stuff and then this as a slightly more refined blog/home page. I might tweak the index.html to have “an about” at the top. It’s quite the all-in mode but this is a much better static gen site than I used to have and whilst I do like my novelty css alexjj.com landing page, it’s a little pointless. hmm have to think about it some more.

    * No new mac mini. Possibly good for me as, if I do buy one, I’ll find a decent deal on the existing….unless I want 16GB RAM…

* October 17

    * Decided (for now) instead of a GRiii(x), I should get a 18mm lens for Fuji. The f/1.4 is nice but pricey and big, so sprung for the older 18mm f/2. It’s tiny, light and has a cool square metal lens hood (that makes your photos look better). It gets a lot of hate online but most likely (a) it’s fine, (b) I won’t be able to tell. It’ll be my Q2 😅

    * Fuji Portrait Lens

        * I’m interested in also getting the 60mm f/2.4 macro lens too. Another (according to the internet) a runt of the Fuji litter. I don’t have anything fast in the range 50-90mm on APS-C. The macro feature tempts me for film scanning. The alternatives are the 50mm f/2, nice little lens, 56mm f/1.2, the classic portrait lens and that f/1.2 but big, the 90mm f/2, appears to be the “best” lens ever but even bigger, then 80mm macro, supposedly the best macro but also massive.

            * Oh and the 50mm f/1.0 🤑

        * Whilst I want the 56mm, I’m not sure I’d really use it that much, and probably better getting the 50mm f/2 for speed, weight and WR. Of course the 56mm is supposed to have *character*. The 60mm is virtually same weight as 50mm f/2 and will have more compression with a bit longer plus, again, the macro function.

    * [It was funny reading Dave describe his perfect app that he wants](http://scripting.com/2021/10/15/154202.html?title=theMobileAppIWant). I feel like I’m pretty much there with Tiddlywiki hosted on github pages (or a self hosted nodejs would work). It’s not a native app, it’s a web app but it works perfectly on phone and tablet.

    * The Ricoh GR iii is £750 new. GRiiix is £900 new. £150 for 40mm vs 28mm.

    * Drummer Pros

        * This site is much more convenient for entering text throughout the day, and also just for general rearrangement of text. Images are a little more time consuming to setup, bit like how TW was before that uploader plugin, so not a huge deal. Plus most of the time I don’t bother with images. Although I do like the little right aligned ones people drop in.

        * It’s nice having other outliner files just here for private or draft stuff too. Or even just commenting out sections for later if I don’t finish them in time.

            * There’s probably a lot more to the “environment” that I’ve not realised yet.

        * When I was looking for a static generator and a web based editor system, **this** is what I was looking for.

        * I like the linklog, doesn’t need explanation.

    * Tiddlywiki Pros

        * Seamless transition between journal entries and a wiki.

            * There’s more scope to join things together over time

        * Search built in on the website

            * Drummer’s search is on the editor not the website.

        * Entirely self-hosted and git managed

        * Mature, and big community with lots of support/plugins etc.

            * Not that I use many but things like uploader plugin are community developed

        * The text editing is more straightforward, but maybe I’ve just not got used to drummer yet.

        * I quite like a tiddler a day, although outliner mode of drummer means I can close off days/months easily.

        * I can use it quite easily on my phone. Drummer is not great on my phone.

    * Conclusion

        * I’m not sure today. It can’t replace the wiki but how should I use them together. Duplicate info? TW is just for me and drummer is for the world (so more polished?) Drummer could take the place of my blog, and maybe that’s the best thing.

        * So then where should it sit in my the domain structure?

    * Decisions on web logging

        * [Jack](https://rudimentarylathe.org/2021/10/17.html#a101131) - I think the ordering during a day only matters if you update yourself. e.g. trying to fix x at 10am. 6 hours later “I found the solution”. Then in time order makes more sense. Of course with an outliner style (vs. TW) you can always just do a new level underneath. Personally speaking, I like the idea of it being in the order of the day for when I go back and look at it and remember that day. I suppose it’s easy to do with just reordering levels.

        * Writing this makes me wonder if a “conversation” section of the day makes sense - bit like how you started tagging things with conversation.

    * Drummer config fiddling

        * Success! I’ve not got the templates hosted from github pages. I must’ve had a bad line as I copied them again from drummercms and then edited the css/js urls.

        * This [url](http://drummer.scripting.com/thealexjj/blog.opml) gets my opml file.

        * Tweaking the [css](https://github.com/alexjj/drummer-blog/commit/51269552c17e78dfd05a227e4ced583da2e29d70). \[\[drummer-meta\]\]

* October 16

    * Starting out with Drummer.

        * Actually this is the 3rd time but that’s always the charm right?

        * [These notes](https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/10/16/getting-started-blogging.html) are very useful to get going.

        * Setting up https and custom domain but it’s getting a bit late.

            * I had thought I could use [github pages](https://alexjj.github.io/drummer-blog/) for hosting the static files but it doesn’t seem to like it. Not quite sure why as it mostly renders the page but just not everything? 🤔 Well I’ll keep copyings in the git repo and just host on my own server. Having in git is handy but just a shame I can’t use the hosting!

            * I realised that I had omitted the https in the reference to the stylesheet and code, and GH pages only permits https then it probably isn’t finding it…

# Standalone pages
